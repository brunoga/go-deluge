go-deluge
=========

Deluge remote API wrapper in Go.

This library provides a wrapper to Deluge's (http://deluge-torrent.org) Remote API (JSON over HTTP). This allows
you to write code to control it remotely.

So far, only the methods associated with adding torrents to it are implemented. Adding any other method is pretty
straight forward, in any case.
